#   Problem:    Some clients have their contract based on enrrollments and if they don't use terms it's difficult 
#               to get that number of enrollemtns per year   
#   Description: This script will read a enrollments CSV file exported from the root account as a provisioning
#                report and getting the students IDs, then calling the enrollment API calls to get: 
#                user_id,
#                course_id, 
#                enrollment_id,
#                enrollment_type,
#                created_at, 
#                updated_at,
#                enrollment_state, 
#                last_activity_at
